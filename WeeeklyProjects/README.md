## Weekly Projects
Each week of the course focused on a distinct aspect of risk management, culminating in a project that applied theoretical concepts to practical scenarios.

### [Week 2: Bias, Model Fitting, and Time Series Simulation](https://github.com/QijunYang1/Quantitative-Risk-Management/tree/main/WeeeklyProjects/week02)

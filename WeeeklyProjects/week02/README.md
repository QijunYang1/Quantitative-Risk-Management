# Project 2
 
## Guide
  - [Project-2.ipynb](https://github.com/QijunYang1/Quantitative-Risk-Management/blob/main/WeeeklyProjects/week02/code/Project-2.ipynb) is my code 
  - [Project2.pdf](https://github.com/QijunYang1/Quantitative-Risk-Management/blob/main/WeeeklyProjects/week02/report/Project2.pdf) is my answer
  - [plot_pkg.py](https://github.com/QijunYang1/Quantitative-Risk-Management/blob/main/WeeeklyProjects/week02/code/plot_pkg.py) is a module
    
 ## Ways to run my code
  - run the code in juypter notebook (`pip install jupyter notebook` on your terminal if you have not installed it.)
  - runipy .ipynb in your terminal (`pip3 install runipy` if you have not installed it.)
  - use ipython to run my code

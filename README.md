# Fintech-545 Quantitative Risk Management

Quantitative Risk Management offers a hands-on introduction to the science and implementation of risk analytics. Topics include probability theory, regression and time series analysis, risk metrics such as Value at Risk and Excepted Shortfall, derivative valuation methods, stress testing and scenario analysis, factor models, and portfolio construction and optimization.
